# Sheaf

## src

Python application that runs the experiment outlined in our paper. 
Generates a system of stoichiometric reactions, a permuted system of 
stoichiometric equations, and synthetic data for each. A sheaf is then 
constructed from the original system of reactions, and assigned each set of
data. Model fitness is calculated for each assignment, as well as 
from least squares analysis.
